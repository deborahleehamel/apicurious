Built a basic version of the Github profile / feed UI. As a user, you are able to:

##Authenticate with my github account
##View basic information about my account (profile pic, number of starred repos, followers, following)
##View a summary feed of my recent activity (recent commits)
##View a summary feed of recent activity from users whom I follow
##View a list of organizations I'm a member of
##View a list of my repositories
